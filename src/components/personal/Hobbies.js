          title="Working Out"
          picture={weightsPicture}
          description="Almost every day, I eagerly wait for my workout. I love it all, even cardio. Pushing my limits, refining my workouts and diet, and seeing gradual progress over the last few years have been immensely gratifying. Helping my interested friends get started and seeing their progress has been even more rewarding."

          title="Cooking"
          picture={cookingPicture}
          description="Initially, I was not the biggest fan of cooking, but now I love it. With practice and help from my family, I can now quickly cook healthy, delicious meals. At the moment, I am pretty good at grilling and cooking proteins. I want to learn how to cook more elaborate, complex meals like paella."

        <PictureCard
          title="Coding"
          picture={codingPicture}
          description="Seeing what problems I can solve and what I can build through code, the logic and planning that goes into a well-designed solution, and learning technologies to tackle new problems are just a few of the reasons I love coding and computer science. Whether it is writing scripts, building systems, or analyzing data, I enjoy the process of problem-solving."

          title="Reading"
          picture={readingPicture}
          description="Stoicism, behavioral economics, and psychology are a few of my favorite subjects other than my academic and career interests. Some of my favorite books are The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, and The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Recently, I enjoyed Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki. Please reach out if you have any recommendations!"

          title="Walking and Hiking"
          picture={walkingPicture}
          description="There is something so peaceful about walking or hiking, especially in nature. In Minnesota, I do not get to go for many walks when it is nice out, so I make the most of the opportunities I get. Lately, I've visited my family in Utah and gone on numerous breathtaking hikes. Both walking and hiking help me disconnect from work and school and return focused."

        <PictureCard
          title="Gaming"
          picture={gamingPicture}
          description="I love playing both single and multiplayer games with or without friends. Recently, I have loved Assassinâ€™s Creed; Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla were all great. Cyberpunk 2077 is also good now after all of the patches. I am excited for Starfield to come out soon and Elder Scrolls 6, probably after I graduate."
